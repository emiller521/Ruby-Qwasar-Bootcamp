First part of coding is to create variable. Let's get started with an integer variable. What does it mean "integer variable?" In most languages you have "types", a good comparaison is a letter is different from a number. In a computer everything is numbers (0 and 1). But we, as human, interact with letter (and words) to make it usuable there are "convention": a letter is a number and one of this table of convertion is: ASCII (you should google man ascii)

Enough talking!

****Replace/Complete the following code.****

  ****CREATE A VARIABLE WITH (IF NEEDED) THE RIGHT TYPE. (XX is what you need to replace)****
  
      XX = 34
      puts(person_age)

****OUTPUT:****

    Input: 
    Output: 34

    Return Value: NULL
