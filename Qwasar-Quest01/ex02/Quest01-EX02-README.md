The first part of coding is to create a variable. Let's get started with an integer variable. What does an "integer variable‚Äù mean? In most languages, you have "types". A good comparison is that a letter is different from a number. In a computer, everything is numbered (0 and 1). But we, as humans, interact with a letter (and words) to make it useable there is "convention": a letter is a number and one of this table of conversion is: ASCII (you should google man ASCII)

Enough talking!

Replace/Complete the following code. 

Create a variable with (if needed) the right type. (XX is what you need to replace)
