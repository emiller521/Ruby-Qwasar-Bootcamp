The first part of coding is to create a variable. Let's get started with an integer variable. What does an "integer variable” mean? In most languages, you have "types". A good comparison is that a letter is different from a number. In a computer, everything is numbered (0 and 1). But we, as humans, interact with a letter (and words) to make it useable there is "convention": a letter is a number and one of this table of conversion is: ASCII (you should google man ASCII)

Enough talking!

****Replace/Complete the following code.****

  ****CREATE A VARIABLE WITH (IF NEEDED) THE RIGHT TYPE. (XX is what you need to replace)****
  
    XX = 'c'
    puts(my_letter)

****OUTPUT:****

    Input: 
    Output: c

    Return Value: NULL
