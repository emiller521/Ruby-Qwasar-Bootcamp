We have been provided a dataset of sales from ****My Online Coffee Shop**** . It's a ****CSV**** (Comma Separated Values) (each columns are separated by , and each line by \n) Our goal will be to identify customer who are more likely to buy coffee online.

Ok, this time we will have to create a function with code logic and not just return the solution hard coded :D

Data management is hard problem, as hard problem we have to split them into smaller one.

Here is our second step: data transformation. This exercise follow step one.

You will receive the output of your function my_data_transform.

Our function will group the data and it will become a Hash of hash. 

****Example:****

	"{'Gender': {'Male': 22, 'Female': 21}, 'Email': {'yahoo.com': 3, 'hotmail.com': 2}, ...}"


We will discard the column FirstName, LastName, UserName and Coffee Quantity from our output.

Your function will be prototyped: ****def my_data_process**** . It will take a string array which is the output of your function ****MY_DATA_TRANSFORM**** , it will return a json string of hash of hash following this format: 

	{COLUMN: {Value1: nbr_of_occurence_of_value_1, Value2: nbr_of_occurence_of_value_2, ...}, ...} 

The order of Columns will be the order they are in the header of the CSV (Gender first then Email, etc) 

****Order of the Value will be the order they appear in each line from top left.****

	##
	##
	## QWASAR.IO -- my_data_process
	##
	##
	## @param {String[]} param_1
	##
	## @return {string}
	##
	
	
	def my_data_process(param_1)
	
	end

****EXAMPLE:****

	Input: 
	["Gender,FirstName,LastName,UserName,Email,Age,City,Device,Coffee Quantity,Order At", "Male,Carl,Wilderman,carl,yahoo.com,21->40,Seattle,Safari iPhone,2,afternoon", "Male,Marvin,Lind,marvin,hotmail.com,66->99,Detroit,Chrome Android,2,afternoon", "Female,Shanelle,Marquardt,shanelle,hotmail.com,21->40,Las Vegas,Chrome,1,afternoon", "Female,Lavonne,Romaguera,lavonne,yahoo.com,66->99,Seattle,Chrome,2,morning", "Male,Derick,McLaughlin,derick,hotmail.com,41->65,Chicago,Chrome Android,1,afternoon"]
	
	Output:
	'{"Gender":{"Male":3,"Female":2},"Email":{"yahoo.com":2,"hotmail.com":3},"Age":{"21->40":2,"66->99":2,"41->65":1},"City":{"Seattle":2,"Detroit":1,"Las Vegas":1,"Chicago":1},"Device":{"Safari iPhone":1,"Chrome Android":2,"Chrome":2},"Order At":{"afternoon":4,"morning":1}}'
